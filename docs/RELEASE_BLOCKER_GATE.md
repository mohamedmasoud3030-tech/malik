# Release blocker gate

## Decision rule

No visual improvement, refactor, naming cleanup, or repository reorganization is part of this gate. Release is blocked only by:

1. data loss or partial writes;
2. real authentication failure;
3. contract creation failure or invalid overlap;
4. collection failure or a serious financial inconsistency;
5. a critical authorization or secret-exposure defect.

A skipped or conditionally omitted blocker test is a failure. Missing staging secrets produce `BLOCKED`, never `PASS`.

## Executable coverage

| Risk | Executable evidence | Environment | Pass condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data loss / partial writes | `supabase/tests/release_blockers.sql` after a full empty-database migration replay | Isolated local Supabase in CI | Every migration applies; rejected overpayment leaves invoice, payment, and receipt counts unchanged |
| Authentication | `rentrix-app/e2e/release-blocker-auth.spec.ts` | Deployed staging with a dedicated test account | Valid login, invalid password, invalidated session, and logout all execute with zero skips |
| Contract creation | `supabase/tests/release_blockers.sql` | Isolated local Supabase in CI | ADMIN creates one valid contract; USER is denied; overlapping dates are rejected |
| Collection / financial safety | `supabase/tests/release_blockers.sql` plus the existing financial suite | Isolated local Supabase in CI | One payment and one receipt per request ID; correct paid amount; negative and excessive amounts fail without partial writes |
| Critical security | SQL RLS/role tests, safe `search_path` catalog assertions, and `scripts/check-release-secret-leaks.sh` | Isolated local Supabase and production browser build artifact | Anonymous/USER access is denied where required; critical definer RPCs pin search path; no private-key/service-role marker reaches `dist` |

## CI jobs

The workflow `.github/workflows/release-blocker-gate.yml` exposes three explicit jobs:

- `release-blocker-code`
- `release-blocker-database`
- `release-blocker-authenticated-staging`

The database job creates an ephemeral Supabase configuration, starts an isolated stack, replays the complete migration chain from an empty database, then executes pgTAP tests. It does not connect to production.

The staging authentication job fails before Playwright starts when any required value is absent:

- `E2E_STAGING_BASE_URL`
- `E2E_TEST_EMAIL`
- `E2E_TEST_PASSWORD`
- `E2E_SUPABASE_URL`
- `E2E_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

Playwright traces, screenshots, video, and reports are retained only on failure.

## Current execution status

Branch: `agent/release-blocker-gate`

Status: **PENDING CI EXECUTION**

No launch-readiness claim is made until all three jobs execute successfully with zero skipped blocker tests. A missing staging secret or a failed empty-database replay makes the result **BLOCKED** and must be resolved before release.

## Deferred observations

Any non-blocking UX, architecture, naming, code organization, or documentation preference discovered while this gate runs is recorded separately and is not implemented in this scope.
