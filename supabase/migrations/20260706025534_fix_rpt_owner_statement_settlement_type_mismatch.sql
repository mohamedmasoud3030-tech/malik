-- owner_settlements.owner_id is text but owners.id / p_owner_id is uuid.
-- s.owner_id = p_owner_id had no operator and would raise a hard error the
-- moment any settlement rows existed in the date range. Not wired into the
-- frontend yet, so zero live impact, but fixing while auditing this class
-- of bug. Signature unchanged.
